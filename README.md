## Installation Requirements

### System Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- CUDA support (recommended for GPU acceleration)
- At least 4GB RAM
- USB camera or video files

### Dependency Installation

1. **Clone the project**:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ICCViewer
```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
```bash
conda create -n iccviewer python=3.9
conda activate iccviewer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Build GroundingDINO and Yolov5**:
- On LINUX
```bash
cd GroundingDINO
python setup_LINUX.py build_ext --inplace
```

- On Windows
   - Install CUDA Toolkit
   - Install VS 2019 Compiler
   - Build GroundingDINO

```bash
cd GroundingDINO
python setup_WIN.py build_ext --inplace
```

- Build yolov5
```bash
cd yolov5
pip install -r requirements
```

4. **Install model weights**:

#### Grounding DINO
```bash
cd GroundingDINO/groundingdino/
# Download pre-trained weights
wget https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO/releases/download/v0.1.0-alpha/groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth
# Place the weight file in the GroundingDINO/ directory
```

#### YOLOv5
```bash
# YOLOv5 weights will be automatically downloaded on first run
# Or manually download to yolov5/ directory
wget https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases/download/v7.0/yolov5s.pt
```

## Usage

### Starting the Software
```bash
python main.py
```

### Basic Operations

1. **Select Detection Model**:
   - Choose "Grounding DINO" or "YOLOv5" from the dropdown menu
   - Models will automatically load and switch

2. **Using Grounding DINO**:
   - Enter the object to detect in the text prompt box (e.g., "crocodile", "person", "car")
   - Adjust box threshold and text threshold
   - View real-time detection results

3. **Using YOLOv5**:
   - Select pre-trained weights (n/s/m/l/x)
   - Adjust confidence and IoU thresholds
   - View detection results for predefined categories

4. **Video Operations**:
   - **Play Local Video**: Click "Play Local Video" button to select file
   - **Pause/Resume Camera**: Click "Pause Camera" button
   - **Start/Stop Saving**: Record detection results to video file

5. **Fullscreen Mode**:
   - Double-click video area to enter fullscreen
   - Press ESC or F11 to exit fullscreen

### Advanced Settings

- **Downsampling**: Check "Downsample Input" for performance improvement
- **Parameter Adjustment**: Use sliders to adjust detection parameters in real-time
- **Weight Switching**: Switch between different model sizes in YOLOv5 mode

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Camera cannot be opened**:
   - Check if USB camera is properly connected
   - Confirm camera is not occupied by other programs
   - Try restarting the software

2. **Model loading fails**:
   - Check if model weight files exist
   - Confirm CUDA environment is properly configured
   - View error log for detailed information

3. **Performance issues**:
   - Enable downsampling option
   - Use smaller model weights
   - Close other GPU-occupying programs

4. **Interface display issues**:
   - Check if PySide6 is properly installed
   - Confirm display settings
   - Try running in headless mode

### Logging
The software generates an `app_error.log` file during runtime containing detailed operation logs and error information.

## Development Notes

### Architecture Design
- **VideoThread**: Independent thread responsible for video capture
- **DetectorManager**: Manages loading and switching of different detection models
- **MainWindow**: Main interface and user interaction logic

### Extending Features
The software uses a modular design that makes it easy to add new detection models:
1. Add new loading methods in `DetectorManager`
2. Add corresponding UI controls in `MainWindow`
3. Add detection logic in `update_frame`
